## General Concept:
Created the concept of ATM machine by using the Java language. After running this code you will have to add your ATM # and pin and if it is correct than it will let you the multiple selections where you can view your statement, deposit, withdraw, or view Ministatement.

**There are two arrays used to store ATM # and pin #. Without correct ATM number and PIN, the code will not executed completely. The ATM # and PIN stored in code are given below: **

| ATM NUMBER | PIN |
| --- | --- |
| 406417 | 5555 |
| 656668 | 7777 |
| 86689853 | 6666 |
| 989898 | 8888 |
| 5656656 | 9999 |
| 575859 | 1313 |
| 607080 | 4444 |
| 9090100 | 1111 |

## Java features used:

- **HashMap**: class which is used to perform operations such as inserting, deleting and locating elements in a map.
- **Map**: an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys: Each key can map to at most one value. It models the mathematical function abstraction.  
- **if else loop**: Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true. Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false. Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.  
- **while loop**: a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. While loop in Java comes into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements.  
- **break**: used to break out a for loop, a while loop or a switch block.  
- **for loop**: a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to be executed a specific number of times. A for loop is useful when you know how many times a task is to be repeated.  
- **interface**: an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class. An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods. The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
- **object**: a member (also called an instance) of a Java class.  
- **class**: a user-defined type that describes what a certain type of object will look like
- **implement**: keyword is used to implement an interface.  
- **Scanner**: class is used to get user input, and it is found in the java.util package.  
- **arrays**: a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **Constructor**: a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.  
- **getter-setter method**: are used to protect your data, particularly when creating classes. For each instance variable, a getter method returns its value while a setter method sets or updates its value.
